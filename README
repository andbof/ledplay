Ledplay is a small project aimed as a childrens toy. It uses a Cortex M0+
(Kinetis KE04, MKE04Z8VWJ4) to light button leds in binary order, waiting for
them to be pressed. When a complete number has been pressed, it progresses to
the next, until all have been exhausted. It then resets from one.

SCHEMATICS AND PCB

  Schematic and PCB are made in Kicad. The PCB is a four layer board (mostly
  because I wanted to play with multilayer boards).

COMPILING

  Enter the src directory and run "make". You need a standard gcc arm toolchain
  (arm-none-eabi-*) installed, but nothing else. Ledplay does not use CMSIS.
