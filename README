Ledplay is a small project aimed as a childrens toy. It uses a Cortex M0+
(Kinetis KE04, MKE04Z8VWJ4) to light button leds in binary order, waiting for
them to be pressed. When a complete number has been pressed, it progresses to
the next, until all have been exhausted. It then resets from one.

DESIGN RATIONALE

  Power efficiency was paramount, but I still wanted to retain programmability
  and flexibility for future use cases. The whole circuit is running at around
  130 uA when no leds are lit, giving it a runtime of about 1 to 1.5 years on
  two double AA batteries. There are no current limiting resistors for the leds
  and the led dc-dc drives them using constant voltage, but they won't be lit
  long enough for their resistance drop to become a problem.

  The led dc-dc is a SEPIC because originally, the leds would be driven with a
  lower voltage, but they turned out to be too dim.

SCHEMATICS AND PCB

  Schematic and PCB are made in Kicad. The PCB is a four layer board (mostly
  because I wanted to play with multilayer boards).

COMPILING

  Enter the src directory and run "make". You need a standard gcc arm toolchain
  (arm-none-eabi-*) installed, but nothing else. Ledplay does not use CMSIS.
